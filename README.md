# Christmas Coding Challenge 2024 - JavaScript Solutions
Welcome to my Christmas Coding Challenge 2024 repo. This project is organized by the [Women Coding Community](https://womencodingcommunity.com/). Through this challenge, I'm committing to solving one [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) or Northcoders problem from the 1st to the 25th of December 2024.

## 📅 Challenge Goals
- Solve one LeetCode problem or Northcoders katas in JavaScript everday.
- Focus on a variety of topics such as arrays, strings, dynamic programming, graphs, and more.
- Document each solution with explanations and, if relevant, alternative approaches or optimizations.
